        <p class="lead mb-4">Jonathan Cardenas a current student at University of Riverside who has two associate degrees one in arts and humanities and another in social and behavioral sciences<br><br>

        Some of my skills include my ability to communicate with others effectively and efficiently as my greatest skill. Participating in multiple activities in school such as being part of the schoolâ€™s soccer team has helped me better develop my communication skills with people. Actively speaking to teammates allowed me to improve upon my skills to effectively get my point across.In the field, we had to speak efficiently as we had to make split second decisions with the information that our teammates communicated. Soccer wasnâ€™t the only way that I developed my communication skills, I also took a Public Speaking college course. Taking this college course greatly improved my communication skills, mainly by improving the way I efficiently get my ideas across. I distinctly remember a lesson in this where we were learning how to connect with the audience and how to communicate an idea effectively. I was able to display this in a club that I am a part of, specifically esports, as I was the person who was making the flyers for the events. One of the best flyers I made was for a fundraiser where we wanted students to know where the money is going towards, how we would be getting the money, and how the students will be needed to make it happen. With ASB, you constantly have to communicate with many people about different tasks. We were always under time crunches, as our school never gave us enough time, meaning we had to be efficient with our communication. I can confidently say that my communication has become one of my greatest skills.<br><br>
       In addition to my skill to communicate effectively with others I can be a great leader and step up when needed. My experience from being a leader has come from being part of the leadership class and Associated Student Body, also known as ASB, with leadership, I would have to take charge and help with school events such as the Hispanic heritage month, the school dia de Los Muertos event, and with fun Fridays that we had. For the Hispanic heritage assembly we had at the end of Hispanic heritage month, I was put in charge of putting up decorations and cleaning the auditorium. My ability to lead greatly helped as we finished faster than our advisor thought we would.  While for ASB, I would have to take charge to help set up senior activities such as Senior Freshy Buddy Day, which is an event where seniors are given freshmen to give them advice and help them out with anything they need.
